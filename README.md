The GreeterPlugin is developed by Funlerz (http://funlerz.com) and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/Funlerz/GreeterPlugin

Greeter strives to provide a simple way for server admins to greet new and existing players.

This README is for Greeter version 0.2.4 on 1.8.7 servers.

Features:

* Players can see a greeting message set by the server administrator. Set the message by going into the "GreeterPlugin" folder inside the server's plugin folder and open "config.yml" and change the "join_message" line. If "{name}" is used in the custom greeting, it will be replaced with the player's name when they join.
